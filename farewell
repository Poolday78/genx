I am leaving here today with a wealth of knowledge I will always treasure. Working here has been a fantastic learning experience, and I am thankful for the skills I've acquired. I feel as if being here with you all each day has made me a more complete and well-rounded person.
Being part of a team has taught me skills that I can use in more than just the professional area of my life. My relationships on a personal level are in a better place than they were, thanks to some of the things I've learned from many of you.
I've come to realize that being a part of a community is more than just sharing credit. A team effort takes compromise. When you are on a team you have to at times lead, follow, and more often than not, meet in the middle.
My wish for everyone here is that you all continue to experience success, to feel fulfilled in all you do, and to have nothing but pleasant results with each completed project!
I am not leaving to create another child of this little big community but i found myself interested in other things more.
It's been a pleasure working here, and I will genuinely miss it. I take with me fond memories, valuable skills, and I hope to one day leave an impression on others similar to the one you have left on me.
Thank you ~ThatPool (ex genx developer)
